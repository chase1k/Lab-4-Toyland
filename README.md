# Lab-4-Toyland

This is a lab that I have completed for my computer science class.
Not all the code was by me, some of the code was made by the instructor adding some functionality that didn't concern what we were learning and the base template for what I coded.

This lab taught Inheritance and Generics

The prior labs 1-3 used python, were kind of basic, and did not use github so I have not uploaded them.
Those labs covered basic python, Recursion, Searching and Sorting, Lists and Tuples, and Files
They were basically a reminder of topics covered in the AP Comp Sci class in highschool and Python
